# Machine learning for Flappy Bird game
A machine learning model that will learn and play flappy bird game. The model is developed using a combination of **Neural networks** and **Genetic algorithm**, combinely known as **NEAT algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)**.

## Setup instructions
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
